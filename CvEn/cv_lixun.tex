\section*{Project Experience}
\begin{description}
  \item[Audio Framework \hspace{0.2in} 2014 - 2015] \hfill \\
  Audio Framework is the software "Skeleton" defined for any amplifier products on how the audio data are routed and processed. Together with signal processing building blocks as the "muscle", the core functionality of an amplifier emerges. My achievement is, for the first time, a systematic description of the working mechanism of the "skeleton" and "muscle" has been formed within the company. The resultant document is extremely useful for both novice and experienced amplifier design engineers.
  \item[Active Noise Cancellation \hspace{0.2in} 2014 - 2015] \hfill \\
  Active Noise Cancellation is a widely used technique to suppress unwanted noise in an optimal sense via dynamic algorithms. The main purpose is to reduce engine sound orders for quieter cabinet in passenger cars. My achievement is build of the application document and simulation tool for cross-amplifier porting.
  \item[Novel Control of Tracking Power Supply \hspace{0.2in} 2014 - 2015] \hfill \\
  Control of tracking power supply often requires high precision DAC chip for rail indication. My achievement here is the elimination of the DAC chip but utilizing the digital port alone of the DSP chip for rail indication. Cost down is achieved thanks to this novel method of power rail control in H-class PSU.
  \item[Chime Control via Block Based Processing \hspace{0.2in} 2014 - 2015] \hfill \\
  Chime or beep sounds are often implemented in the rear stages of a fixed point DSP for short time latency in sample-based fashion. Sometimes however, minimal hardware change criterion implies an implementation on block based DSP such as ${\textit SHARC^{TM}}$. The achievement here is such pilot implementation, showing acceptable latency in practice.
  \vspace{0.3in}
  \item[Generation II of ${\textit ACOspector^{TM}}$ \hspace{0.2in} 2012 - 2014] \hfill \\
  Update of generation I of this non-invasive measurement instrument. Improved FPGA design with fine PCB layout. Update of the firmware and software design mainly focuses on system reliability and security.Better signal processing algorithm has also been devised and employed.
  \item[Generation I of ${\textit ACOspector^{TM}}$ \hspace{0.2in} 2010 - 2012] \hfill \\
  Lead the development of the industrial fluid property measurement sensor based on active acoustic spectroscopy measurement. Products have been deployed among pulp and paper, chemical factories in Sweden. Some information can be found in \href{http://www.acosense.com}{\tt www.acosense.com}. The concept is based on IoT and cloud computing --- compact, robust and low-cost sensor terminal group paired with one centralized server for data processing in star-topology network. Machine learning running in the backbone builds regression models for fluid property estimation. Hence multiple measurement points can be monitored non-invasively at extremely low cost for modern data-driven factories. As the system designer and developer, my contribution: the path finder of such promising measurement method for the cloud computing age.
  \vspace{0.3in}
  \item[Matrix Power Converter Design and Implementation \hspace{0.2in} 2007 - 2008] \hfill \\
  Matrix power converter has the merit of higher energy density compared to traditional back-to-back rectifier-inverter topology. Nevertheless the synchronized control of all semiconductor switchers poses harder control problem against the old. In this National Science Foundation project, theory of matrix converters has been studied and a prototype has been engineered. The novel prototype is based on four-leg structure thus allows for more intuitive implementation in a carrier-modulation style.
