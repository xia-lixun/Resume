## **Projects**
* **_Microsoft Cortana Frontend Speakerphone_** (2016 - 2017)

    Harman's solution for Microsoft in far-field speech comminication. My contribution includes: (a) design and implement tuning interface for automatic verifications (b) automate measuring processing to allow fast parameter searching for performance optimation

* **_Acoustic Feature Engineering_** (2015 - 2016)

    Exctracting an useful set of acoustic features for voice-activity detection (VAD), and many more, for example real-time sound event detection. Combined with various machine learning models, sounds are becoming more and more important in both every day life and industry.

* **_Novel Control of Tracking Power Supply_** (2014 - 2015)

    Control of tracking power supply often requires high precision DAC chip for power rail indication. My achievement here is the elimination of the DAC chip but utilizing the digital port alone of the DSP chip for rail indication. Cost down has been achieved thanks to this novel method of power rail control in H-class PSU.

* **_ACOspector(TM) – non-invasive fluid measurement in real-time_** (2010 - 2014)

    Lead the development of the industrial fluid property measurement sensor based on active acoustic spectroscopy measurement. Products have been deployed among pulp and paper, chemical factories in Sweden. Some information can be found in [_www.acosense.com_](www.acosense.com). The concept is based on IoT and cloud computing — compact, robust and low-cost sensor terminal group paired with one centralized server for data processing in star-topology network. Machine learning running in the backbone builds regression models for fluid property estimation. Hence multiple measurement points can be monitored non-invasively at extremely low cost for modern data-driven factories. As the system designer and developer, my contribution: the path finder of such promising measurement method for the industrial 4.0.

* **_Matrix Power Converter Design and Implementation_** (2007 - 2008)

    Matrix converter can be used as motor drivers(PSM, Induction Motor) thanks to its high power density. This is an academic project for my first graduate thesis. Matrix power converter has the merit of higher energy density compared to traditional back-to-back rectifierinverter topology. Nevertheless the synchronized control of all semiconductor switchers poses harder control problem against the old. In this National Science Foundation project, theory of matrix converters has been studied and a prototype has been engineered. The novel prototype is based on four-leg structure thus allows for more intuitive implementation in a carrier-modulation style.

    This is a national science foundation project thus the deliverables are publications below:
