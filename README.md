    * improved the product to its second generation

* **_Matrix Power Converter Design and Implementation_** (2007 - 2008)

    Matrix converter can be used as motor drivers(PSM, Induction Motor) thanks to its high power density. This is an academic project for my first graduate thesis. Matrix power converter has the merit of higher energy density compared to traditional back-to-back rectifierinverter topology. Nevertheless the synchronized control of all semiconductor switchers poses harder control problem against the old. In this National Science Foundation project, theory of matrix converters has been studied and a prototype has been engineered. The novel prototype is based on four-leg structure thus allows for more intuitive implementation in a carrier-modulation style.

    This is a national science foundation project thus the deliverables are publications below:
